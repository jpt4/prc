*[Subject to review for accuracy]*

*Electronic circuits are not particle propagation systems. Although
current is thought of as flowing from source to sink, if a path
doesn't exist, neither does the capacity for work; voltage-encoded
logical HIGH and LOW signal do not test their paths to see if they are
complete. Thus, because a factor at the spatial end of an electrical
circuit (the presence of a sink) effects its beginning (the coursing
of current from source), their exists a non-local effect in analogue
electric circuits compared to the digital logic they support. This
affects the functional formalization of the single transistor RTL NOR
gate, as follows.*
