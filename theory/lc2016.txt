Collapsing the abstraction stack with pervasively reconfigurable computing.

This presentation reports on the progress towards a platform for
pervasively reconfigurable computing (PRC). The existing development
stack is furiously dynamic at the top, where the programmer can (e.g.)
hot-swap packages at will within a
pseudo-LISP-machine-turned-text-editor, but gradually calcifies as
higher layers must conform to inaccessible lower layers: languages
must target compilers which target operating systems which target
architectures, thence to microcode, control signals, and ultimately
the laws of physics. PRC p

(that is, without the distinction between fixed routing fabric and customizable logic slices)
