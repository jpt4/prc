I have overcome the paralysis of over-analysis with respect to
decision making at the time horizon of my lifetime. My lifetime goals
(not terminal goals, because my conception of a terminus reaches
beyond the grasp of my life) are as follows:

1. To not die before the age of 125 years.

2. To not die within Earth's gravity well.

3. To not die before having communicated, in a mutually acknowledged
fashion, with a non-human, human level or greater intelligence.

Of these, the third is first and most salient, and the justification
for this application. Together, they serve as the final metric by
which I measure any dedication of great effort, and short circuit the
endless speculation about the possibilities contained by the vast (yet
viciously finite) future. I know what I want to do, in the limit.

As an intra-systemic observer of finite capacity, that which subsumes
and exceeds oneself is nigh-indistinguishable infinity. These then are
the causes which I will myself to serve, eternally and infinitely,
until, if ever they seem other than infinite, I too will be other than
myself.

For a long time I desired to be a creature of my own devising,
orthogonal to the attractions and distractions of that span of history
through which I walk, but it is only with the above trine that I
determined a suitably transcendent goad.
