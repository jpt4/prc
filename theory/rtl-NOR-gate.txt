The hardware of a PRC machine must be equally formally specified as
the software which it executes. Further, this formal model must
provide complete "logical coverage" in the sense used by Null
Convention Logic: every process of the hardware must be reflected in
the model which describes it, so that large-scale composiitions of
hardware elements do not require new, meta-systems of logic.

Intuitively, digital logic circuits transmit information by
propagating signals between elements. Elements, e.g. gates, do not
operate until a signal reaches them, nor affect other elements aside
from sending signals. This implies an ordering to events that
corresponds with spatial proximity: signals reach an element, are
processed, and new ones repropagated. In this way, all effects are
local, and can be determined by following a contiguous trace of prior
causes where each successive step identifies a logical transformation
with a transition in space.
