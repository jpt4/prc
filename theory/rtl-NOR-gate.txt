Intuitively, digital logic circuits transmit information by
propagating signals between elements. Elements, e.g. gates, do not
operate until a signal reaches them, nor affect other elements aside
from sending signals. This implies an ordering to events that
corresponds with spatial proximity: signals reach an element, are
processed, and new ones repropagated. In this way, all effects are
local, and can be determined by following a contiguous trace of prior
causes where each succesive step identifies a composition of functions
with a transition in space.

Electronic circuits are not particle propagation systems. Although
current is thought of as flowing from source to sink, if a path
doesn't exist, neither does the capacity for work; voltage-encoded
logical HIGH and LOW signal do not test their paths to see if they are
complete. Thus, because a factor at the spatial end of an electrical
circuit (the presence of a sink) effects its beginning (the coursing
of current from source), their exists a non-local effect in analogue
electric circuits compared to the digital logic they support. This
affects the functional formalization of the single transistor RTL NOR
gate, as follows.
