# prc
Pervasively Reconfigurable Hardware

Code, etc. for the project.

Developed against GNU Guile.

3453.scm, 318.scm, and 390.scm implement Universal Cells (UC) which
expose the logical operation of RLEMs 3-453/18/90, respectively. [3453
| 318 | 390]-univ-demo.scm files configure a lattice of UCs into
Geometrically Explicit Logic Circuits (GELC) which demonstrate their
equivalence to universal circuits of standard RLEMs.

univ-[etc].txt is a note, and hexagon.odg a set of figures, describing
the relation between RLEMs and GELCs in greater (though yet terse)
detail.
