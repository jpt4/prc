Universal Geometrically Explicit RLEM Circuits, and their Possible
Implementation

jpt4 UTC20150909

This note demonstrates by construction the computational universality
of geometrically explicit logic circuits (GELCs) composed of certain
Reversible Logic Elements with Memory [0]. It is known that circuits
of 2-state 3-symbol RLEMs are computationally universal [0], without
formal regard for the geometry of their wires. GELCs built from
{3-453, 3-3}, {3-90, 3-3}, and {3-18, 3-18w [1]} can simulate the
universal circuits of 3-453, 3-90, and 3-18, with the additional
constraint of mandating a certain form to signal transport wires.

A logic circuit is geometrically explicit if it is composed of logic
circuit elements which specify, as part of their formal definitions,
the geometry (i.e. the size and shape) of the paths connecting the
output and input terminals of symbol processing. Equivalently, a GELC
considers the signal transport element - the wire - as a first class
component, which must be specified alongside the processing elements
of a logic circuit, rather than being left subjective to
implementation (Fig. 1).

RLEMs 3-453, 3-90, and 3-18 were chosen for translation into
geometrically explicit form because their signal routing behavior can
be interpreted as emitting a symbol to the "right" or "left" output
terminal, relative to the symbol's input terminal. Thus, one memory
state encodes "Right Turn" routing, the other "Left Turn" routing
(Fig. 2.). In addition to these symbol processing elements, the GELCs
constructed use the degenerate RLEMs 3-3 and 3-18w
